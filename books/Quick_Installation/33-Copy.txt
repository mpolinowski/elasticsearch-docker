Chapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH

All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow
up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old
she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with
it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for
Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, “Oh, why can’t you
remain like this for ever!” This was all that passed between them on
the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always
know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.

Of course they lived at 14 [their house number on their street], and
until Wendy came her mother was the chief one. She was a lovely lady,
with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth. Her romantic
mind was like the tiny boxes, one within the other, that come from the
puzzling East, however many you discover there is always one more; and
her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get,
though there it was, perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner.

The way Mr. Darling won her was this: the many gentlemen who had been
boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her,
and they all ran to her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling, who
took a cab and nipped in first, and so he got her. He got all of her,
except the innermost box and the kiss. He never knew about the box, and
in time he gave up trying for the kiss. Wendy thought Napoleon could
have got it, but I can picture him trying, and then going off in a
passion, slamming the door.

Mr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him
but respected him. He was one of those deep ones who know about stocks
and shares. Of course no one really knows, but he quite seemed to know,
and he often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that
would have made any woman respect him.

Mrs. Darling was married in white, and at first she kept the books
perfectly, almost gleefully, as if it were a game, not so much as a
Brussels sprout was missing; but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped
out, and instead of them there were pictures of babies without faces.
She drew them when she should have been totting up. They were Mrs.
Darling’s guesses.

An IP camera is a complex product. However, it is not complicated to operate a INSTAR product. In the following we want to give you an introduction to the basic functions of an IP camera. For more information about our cameras you can continue reading the First Steps, where we will dive a little deeper.

What is an IP camera and how does it work? The "IP" in IP-camera stands for "Internet Protocol". This implies that the camera is being connected with a network, from which it can be accessed by other devices. The access is not only possible within the same network, but even through the internet. Using our IP cameras works like this:

You connect your IP camera via LAN cable or wireless with your router. When your computer or smartphone is connected to the same router, you just type the camera´s IP address into your browsers address bar to access the web user interface (1080P MODELS / 720P MODELS). You can also remotely access your camera through the internet. This is possible via DDNS ADDRESS or via a POINT-TO-POINT connection. When you access your camera, you will enter its Web User Interface 1080P MODELS / 720P MODELS. There you can see the current live video and adjust settings such as alarms, schedules or video configuration. Those settings will be saved on the camera. The camera is operating 24/7 and will notify you if something moves within the camera´s field of view. How sensitive the camera´s MOTION DETECTION is, and what happens after the alarm was triggered, can be set individually for each camera. Manual or planned recordings following a SCHEDULE are possible as well. This is the basic concept of our cameras. For further information, you can check out the FIRST STEPS or you browse our Wiki. Of course you can ask us your unanswered questions PERSONALLY as well.

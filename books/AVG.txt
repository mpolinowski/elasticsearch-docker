AVG Internet Security
Set an Exception rule inside your AVG Antivirus Software
In some cases, it can be that the virus scanner AVG is blocking the video stream of your IP camera. Actually it blocks the ActiveX and Quicktime Plugin from receiving the cameras video stream. In this case you will need to set an exception in AVG so it does not block the camera any more.

Step 1: Please start the AVG control panel.

Step 2: Go to Options (Optionen) and Advanced Settings (Erweiterte Einstellungen).

Step 3: Click on Exceptions (Ausnahmen) and add an exception for the affected plugins.

The ActiveX plugin for the HD camera can be found in C:/Windows/SystemWOW64 (or System32) and is called SEWebClientPlus.ocx for the HD cameras (or DVM_IPCam2.ocx in C:\Windows\Downloaded Program Files for the VGA cameras). In case that the HD camera´s video is working but you cannot start the integrated media player - you will need an exception for the file SEPlayerPlus.exe that is also located in C:/Windows/SystemWOW64 (or System32). If you encounter any problems during the settings, please feel free to contact us any time during our office hours. We will try everything to solve the problem as fast as possible.

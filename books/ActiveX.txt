The ActiveX Plugin is needed to display the h.264 stream of your INSTAR HD camera in Microsoft´s Internet Explorer.

In order to assure that the ActiveX Plugin runs without any problems we recommend you to keep the cameras operating system up to date. Please visit our download section from time to time to see if there are new Firmware or WebUI versions for your camera model. The newest versions can always be downloaded from www.instar.de.
